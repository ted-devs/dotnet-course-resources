# C# Programming Course Resources

This repository is a collection of my personal notes that I share with my students for my courses. The main focus of my course is Programming in C#, so it goes over all the basics of the language including Object Oriented Programming. Then it moves to concepts on the .NET framework like Dependency Injection, Middlewares etc. In the end it works towards building an application that consists of some static pages and a REST API that using SQL Server and Entity Framework Core.

Feel free to use these resources as you see fit, and give suggestion and improvements.
